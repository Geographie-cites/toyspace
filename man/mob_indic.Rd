\title{Shape mobility indicators}
\usage{
mob_indic(tabflows, tabdist, idori, iddes, idflow, iddist, pol, idpol)
}
\arguments{
\item{tabflows}{A data.frame of flows between origins and destinations (long format matrix containing, at least, 3 column : origins, destinations, flows)}

\item{tabdist}{An sf object of the cities}

\item{idori}{A character string giving the origin field name in tabflows}

\item{iddes}{A character string giving the destination field name in tabflows}

\item{idflow}{A character string giving the flow field name in tabflows}

\item{iddist}{A character string giving the distance field name in tabflows}

\item{pol}{An sf object of the cities}

\item{idpol}{A character string identifier of cities}
}
\value{
An sf object of the cities with mobility indicators for each polygons

There are 4 mobility indicators :
      - Self-Sufficiency (SelfSuff) : it refers to the ratio between internal flows and the amount of workers.
      It expresses the local balance between workers and jobs with a low rate of outflows
      (from 0 to 1, where 0 express dependency and 1 sufficiency)
      - Dependency (Dependency) : it refers to the ratio between internal flows and the population of the city.
      It expresses the level of dependence of a city in terms of job offer.
      - Mobility (Mobility) : it refers to the ratio between inflows and outflows on one hand, and the amount of workers on the other.
      It expresses the density of displacements in a city.
      - Relative Balance (RelBal) : it refers to the ratio between inflows less outflows on one hand and the population of the city on the other.
      It expresses the degree of polarization of a city, thus its attractiveness in terms of employment.
      - Percentage at Origin (perOri) : it refers to the percentage of total worker living in the city
      - Percentage at Destination (perDes) : it refers to the percentage of total worker working in the city
      - Percentage of InternalFlow (perIntra) : it refers to the percentage of total worker living and working in the city

\description{
This function allows you to create an sf object containing mobility indicators in each polygons using a data.frame of flows
