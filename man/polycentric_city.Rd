\title{DF transform to polycentric urban model}
\usage{
polycentric_city(pol, idpol, cand, tabflows, idori, iddes, idflow)
}
\arguments{
\item{pol}{An sf object of the cities}

\item{idpol}{A character string of the column containing the id of the pol object}

\item{cand}{A character string of the column containing binary (1, 0) candidate value of the pol object (1 must be equal to city considered as employment pole and containing a railroad station)}

\item{tabflows}{A data.frame of flows between origins and destinations (long format matrix containing, at least, origins, destinations, flows)}

\item{idori}{A char}

\item{iddes}{A character string giving the destination field name in tabflows}

\item{idflow}{A character string giving the flow field name in tabflows}
}
\value{
A data.frame of flows as tabflows with origins and destinations changed
}
\description{
This function allows you to change the origins and destination of flows
stored into a dataframe to simulate a polycentric urban model. Cities considered as employment
pole and containing railroad station are designed as candidate and flows (destinations only) are moved
from non-candidate cities to the nearest candidate cities (using osm network)
}

# Import data

idpol <- "idpol"

data(tabflows)

poly_flows <- polycentric_city (
pol = polL93,
idpol = idpol,
cand = cand,
tabflows = tabflows,
iddes = iddes,
idflow = idflow)

poly_flows[1:10,]
